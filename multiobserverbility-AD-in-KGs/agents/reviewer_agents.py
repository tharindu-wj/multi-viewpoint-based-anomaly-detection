"""The second-opinion phase: each observer returns to judge a further batch.

Same observer, same persona, same recorded norms -- a different ADK agent
name only because one tree cannot hold two agents called observer_1. The
instruction does not say where the batch came from, and review_candidates
serves it with a neutral note: an opinion anchored on another opinion is one
opinion twice.

This phase exists because two observers reading different shortlists rarely
meet on the same fact -- and a fact judged by BOTH, differently, is the
architecture's product.
