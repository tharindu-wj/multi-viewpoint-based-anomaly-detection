"""Mining rule: facts the trained link predictor finds unlikely.

TAXO type this rule mines (Senaratne et al., arXiv:2412.04780, section 5):
    Incorrectness - incorrect triples    at large: a false fact tends to
                                         break the regularities the
                                         embedding learned, so a low score
                                         is a falsehood LEAD

The fifth rule, and the one that is a model rather than a count -- kept
alongside the four counting rules as the plausibility channel, because the
two channels fail differently. The model's PROVABLE blind spots are exactly
where the counting rules stand: its score is symmetric under head/tail swap
(direction clashes are invisible -- odd_pairs' ground), popularity biased
(hub anomalies score MORE plausible -- odd_degrees' ground), and per-triple
(a value set's joint oddity has no representation -- odd_values' ground).

WORKED EXAMPLE (invented entities -- no dataset supplies these):

    A --built by-- W    scores 0.97   the model saw many facts shaped
                                      like this one
    A --built by-- Q    scores 0.03   bottom 0.1% -- the model is surprised

Surprise is a LEAD on falsehood, never a verdict. It cuts both ways:
rare-but-TRUE facts also surprise the model and score low, while a planted
FAKE the model memorised during training scores comfortably high. Both
failure modes are real and measured (see DESIGN.md) -- which is exactly why
a judge reads the shortlist instead of trusting the ranking.

HOW IT COUNTS:
    1. Load the scores 2_train_scorer.py wrote offline -- one per kg.tsv
       row, same order -- after checking the manifest hash binds them to
       THIS graph (stale scores refuse loudly).
    2. Rank ALL rows ascending. The percentile in each note is against the
       whole graph, so "bottom 0.4%" means the same thing whatever scope
       the observer chose.
    3. Emit the in-scope triples in that order, least plausible first.

The one rule that needs a model. scripts/2_train_scorer.py trains a KGE
model on the (contaminated) graph and scores EVERY triple once, offline, into
prepared/scores.npy -- so at run time this is an array lookup, no torch, no
40-second model load inside an agent's turn, and the scores are identical
across runs by construction.

The manifest check refuses a score file computed for a different graph: a
stale file would silently score triples that no longer exist.
