"""Tool: the observer's judgement, one verdict per served candidate.

The only place an observer's opinion becomes part of the run. Verdicts refer
to candidate ids from find_suspects, and an id never served to THIS caller
is refused -- no judging facts you were not shown, no judging the other
observer's stack.

Verdicts remove and explain; they never score, rank, or reorder. The kept
order downstream is the mining rules' order -- an LLM output is never a
ranking key.
