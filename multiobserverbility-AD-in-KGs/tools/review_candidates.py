"""Tool: the second-opinion fetch -- the other observer's flags, blind.

THE DISAGREEMENT MECHANISM. Two observers reading different shortlists rarely
judge the same fact, so same-fact disagreement -- the architecture's whole
product -- would be left to luck. This serves each observer the TRIPLES its
counterpart flagged as anomalous, so every flag ends up with two independent
verdicts.

Blind on purpose: the candidates arrive with a neutral note and NO hint of
the other observer's verdict, reasoning, or even that another observer exists.
A second opinion anchored on the first is one opinion twice -- the same
isolation rule the whole tree is built on.
